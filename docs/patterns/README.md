# Problem Solving Patterns

This directory contains documentation of common problem-solving patterns and techniques.

## Common Patterns

### 1. Two Pointers
- **When to use**: Array/string problems requiring pair finding or range checking
- **Examples**: Two Sum, Valid Palindrome, Container With Most Water

### 2. Sliding Window
- **When to use**: Subarray/substring problems with constraints
- **Examples**: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters, Minimum Window Substring

### 3. Binary Search
- **When to use**: Sorted arrays, search space reduction
- **Examples**: Search in Rotated Sorted Array, Find Peak Element

### 4. Dynamic Programming
- **When to use**: Optimization problems, overlapping subproblems
- **Examples**: Fibonacci, Coin Change, Longest Common Subsequence

### 5. BFS/DFS
- **When to use**: Tree/graph traversal, pathfinding
- **Examples**: Binary Tree Level Order, Number of Islands

### 6. Backtracking
- **When to use**: Generating combinations, solving constraint problems
- **Examples**: N-Queens, Sudoku Solver, Permutations
